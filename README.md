## Notes
OWWMRITER or its creator, Jonas Skovmand, is in no way endorsed or affiliated with Ommwriter or its creators & copyright holders, Herraiz Soto & Co. OWWMRITER is just a fun remake of the amazing application Ommwriter, to test what can be accomplished with modern web technologies.

If you like it, buy the real Ommwriter OS X or iPad app from http://www.ommwriter.com. You'll love it even more than this!
